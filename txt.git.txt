 I love to travel—it’s where I feel most alive. Exploring new places, meeting different people, and soaking in unfamiliar cultures fills me with a sense of wonder and freedom. Every journey teaches me something new, not just about the world, but about myself. Travel isn’t just what I do—it’s who I am.
